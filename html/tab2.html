   <h3>What is it?</h3>
   
       <h4> Equinox: </h4>
       <p>
            The equinoxes occur twice a year and are times when day and night are the same length. All the planets in the solar system experience equinoxes. This phenomenon occurs when the sun is exactly over the equator of a planet.
     <br /><br />
   </p>
   <h4> Solstices: </h4>
   <p>
         The solstice is an astronomical phenomenon that represents the moment in which the Sun reaches its greatest declination in latitude with respect to the equator.

   <h3>When does it happen?</h3>
   <h4> Equinox:</h4>

   <p>
         The equinoxes occur in March (between the 19th and 21st) and September (between the 21st and 24th). These are the days when the Sun is exactly over the equator, making day and night the same length.
     <br /><br />
   </p>
 </body>

 <h4> Solstices: </h4>
 <p>
      The solstice, like the equinox, occurs twice a year and marks the entrance of two seasons (winter/summer). The two solstices occur in June (between the 20th or 21st) and December (between the 21st or 22nd). These are the days when the Sun is furthest north or south of the equator.

<h3>Why were they important in ancient times?</h3>

   <p>
         The solstices, along with the equinoxes, are connected to the seasons, harvests, and livelihoods. Therefore, many cultures celebrate various combinations of the solstices, equinoxes, and the midpoints between them, leading to various holidays springing up around these events.
