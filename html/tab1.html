    <h3>What is ?</h3>
    <p>
        Angular parameters that allow establishing the position of the stars. In general, the position of objects in space is defined by means of three numbers (coordinates) that give their distance and direction in a certain reference system.

    <h3>How do celestial coordinates work?</h3>
    }<p>
        The altazimuth coordinate system uses height and azimuth to locate the position of objects on the celestial sphere. The height is measured from the horizon to the object, and the azimuth from the north cardinal point and to the east, both values ​​in degrees.

    <h3>Plane of the ecliptic</h3>
    }<p>
        The ecliptic is the path the Sun appears to follow across the sky over the course of a year. It is also the projection of the Earth's orbital plane on the celestial sphere. The latitude angle is called the ecliptic latitude, and the longitudinal angle is called the ecliptic longitude.

    <h3>What is zenith and nadir?</h3>
    }<p>
        Zenith: intersection of the vertical with the celestial sphere. It is located above the horizon. Nadir: point opposite the zenith located below the horizon.

        <h3>Equatorial parallels.</h3>
        }<p>
            Parallels are imaginary circular lines perpendicular to the Earth's axis, and their reference is the zero parallel, or equator. They are used to determine latitude, which is the angular distance between the equator and any point on the planet.
