    <h3>What is a megalithic structure?</h3>
    <p>
        A megalithic structure is a prehistoric monument made of large stones. The word Megalithic comes from the Greek; "mega" which means big, and "litos" which means stone. Megalithic structures can be found throughout Europe, Russia, the Americas, Africa, and Asia.

    <h3>What it is basically?</h3>
    }<p>
        The alignment of the stones and the way in which the henge (circular structure) opens in the direction of sunrise in summer, indicates that the monument was created as a place of ritual worship of the sun. How it works: Each of the 30 stones in the sarsen stone circle represents a day within a month, divided into three weeks each of 10 days.

    <h3>Why it exists?</h3>
    }<p>
        The purpose of the construction of this great monument is unknown, but it is supposed that it was used as an astronomical observatory that served to predict the seasons, however, more recent studies have revealed that Stonehenge allowed our ancestors to predict celestial events , such as eclipses, solstices and the equinox, very similar to an astronomical observatory today.
